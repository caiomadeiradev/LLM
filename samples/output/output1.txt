Pachamama (also spelled Pacha Mama) is a deity in the Andean mythology of South America, particularly among the indigenous peoples of Peru and Bolivia. The name "Pachamama" roughly translates to "Mother Earth" or "Earth Mother" in the Quechua language.

In Andean culture, Pachamama is considered a powerful and sacred being who embodies the natural world, fertility, and the cycles of life and death. She is often depicted as a gentle, nurturing mother figure who takes care of all living beings and the land itself.

Pachamama is associated with the following qualities:

1. Fertility: She is believed to control the cycles of nature, including growth, decay, and rebirth.
2. Protection: Pachamama is said to protect her people from harm, disease, and natural disasters.
3. Healing: She is often invoked for healing purposes, particularly in relation to physical ailments and spiritual well-being.
4. Respect for Nature: Pachamama teaches respect, care, and reciprocity with the natural world.

In modern times, Pachamama has become an important symbol of environmentalism and eco-awareness, representing a deep connection between humans and the land. Her message emphasizes living in harmony with nature, preserving biodiversity, and taking responsibility for our actions on the planet.

The concept of Pachamama was popularized by the indigenous community in Peru, particularly after the 1980s, when environmental concerns and social issues gained international attention. The name has since been used worldwide to promote sustainable practices, cultural exchange, and a deeper understanding of indigenous perspectives on environmentalism.

In recent years, the term "Pacha Mama" (with an accent mark) was also adopted as the name for the luxury hotel chain in Peru, Pacha Hotels & Resorts, which aimed to embody the spirit of Pachamama through its sustainable tourism practices.
